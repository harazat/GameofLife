# Game of Life
# This is a Game of life implementation in javascript. There are 5 classes (Grass, EatGrass, Gazan, Gishatich,Mard ). All 5 classes create an ecosystem, every class is  dependent  on one other class. They all move, eat, thrive in a canvas. This project is made by using npm, node, sockets io, and knowledge of JS.
